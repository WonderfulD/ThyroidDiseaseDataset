
1. Title: Thyroid Domain

2. Number of Classes: 3
   The problem is to determine whether a patient referred to the clinic is
"   hypothyroid. Therefore three classes are built: normal (not hypothyroid),"
   hyperfunction and subnormal functioning. Because 92 percent of the patients
   are not hyperthyroid a good classifier must be significant better than 92%.

"3. Number of Attributes: 21 (15 attributes are binary,6 attributes are continuous)"
